Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
Tanya Chen, Sarah Qin

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
Wednesday night

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I have to be really specific with everything I want to define. For example, after I added a new_answer, the replacemnet could actually work/ 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Both have very similar logic or maybe all the languages such as conditional statements and loops. 
Python gives more freedom for not exactly naming and writing the types. Java needs to specify everything at first, instead of just naming random things in middle of the loops of function. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Everything that this assignment needs worked. I spend most of the time working on the replacement. I would say use more time to think about the logic, and even specify the things that you think that is uneccesary.
